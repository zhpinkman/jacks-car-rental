The implementation of the jack's rental car with the [`AMALearn`](https://gitlab.com/rooholah/amalearn) package designed to pave the way for having better models accommodating the agent and environment into separate packages.
The problem is actually the problem discussed in the fourth chapter of the `Reinforcement Learning An Introduction` by `Richard S. Sutton` and `Andrew G. Barto`.
