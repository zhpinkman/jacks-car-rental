That would be a good practice to check our model with this definition of MDPs.\n",
    "At each time step, the process is in some state S, and the decision maker may choose any action A  that is available in state S. The process responds at the next time step by randomly moving into a new state S', and giving the decision maker a corresponding reward R. Checking our model with this definition, that would be clear that this task can be easily be modeled as a MDP. "
